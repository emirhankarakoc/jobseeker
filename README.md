## What is Jobseeker and What Does It Do
Jobseeker is a website where you can prepare CVs and cover letters using templates online. It is a platform where you can track the job postings you have applied to and those you plan to apply for.

## What Does This Repo Do
This repo is a simple JSON-to-PDF converter. You register on the server and input your own data. You can enter your education, documents, work experience, languages spoken, and hobbies. This information will automatically be converted into a CV.
<br/> Normally, Jobseeker has 12 themes. I created this project to understand how it works. The CV template is very basic and might not be something you'd like if you saw it as a CV. :)) <br/> You can view a sample of the CV on slide 14 of the following URL.
